The SPM_toolkit contains 4 state-of-the-art neural networks for sentence pair modeling: Paraphrase Identification, Semantic Textual Similarity, Natural Language Inference, and Question Answering.

## A few notes
1. The model was implemented with PyTorch 0.4.0 and Torchtext 0.1.1 .
2. Sample command to run (navigate to the model folder first): python main.py
